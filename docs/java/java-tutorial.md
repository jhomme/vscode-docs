# Getting Started with Java in VS Code

This tutorial shows you how to write and run Hello World program in Java with Visual Studio Code. It also covers a few advanced features, which you can explore by reading other documents in this section.

For an overview of the features available for Java in VS Code, see [Java Language Overview](/docs/languages/java.md)

If you run into any issues when following this tutorial, you can contact us by clicking the **Report an issue** button below.

If you need to install VS Code, [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Supported Java versions

VS Code works with all major versions of Java SE up to 14.

## Setting up Visual Studio Code for Java Development

### Installing a Java Development Kit (JDK)

Before going through this tutorial, your development environment must have a Java SE Development Kit (JDK) installed. If it doesn't, you can download and install a JDK from one of these sources:

* [Oracle Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* [Azul Zulu for Azure - Enterprise Edition](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/)

### Configuring your development environment to use a JDK

Your development environment needs to know where the JDK is located. A common way to do this is [setting the value of the `JAVA_HOME` system environment variable](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html) to the install location of the JDK, for example, `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13.0.2`. Or if you want to configure only VS Code to use the JDK, use the `java.home` setting in [VS Code's User or Workspace settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md).

To help you get started quickly, there are special installers of Visual Studio Code for Java developers, which include all the necessary dependencies and extensions for Java development in Visual Studio Code:

* **Windows:** [Installer of Visual Studio Code for Java developers](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win)
* **macOS:** [Installer of Visual Studio Code for Java developers](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-mac)

> **Note**: The installers are only available for Windows and macOS. For other operating systems, you will need to manually install a JDK, VS Code, and Java extensions.

The package can be used as a clean install, or you can also use it to update an existing development environment to add Java or VS Code. After you've [downloaded](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win)Â and opened it, the installer automatically tries to detect a JDK, VS Code, and essential Java extensions. During install, it downloads the stable versions of those tools from trusted online sources then installs and configures them.

You can also add Java support to VS Code by installing the popular Microsoft [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack), which includes these extensions:

* [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
* [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
* [Java Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test)
* [Maven for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-maven)
* [Java Dependency Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-dependency)

<a class="tutorial-install-extension-btn" href="vscode:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack">Install the Java Extension Pack</a>

You can also select which extensions you would like to install separately. For this tutorial, the only required extensions are

* [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
* [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)

If a JDK is not already installed, the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) provides links to download a reliable JDK.

## Settings for the JDK

To access various settings for using the JDK, bring up the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and use the command **Java: Configure Java Runtime**.

![JDK Configuration](images/java-tutorial/jdk-configuration.png)

The [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack), also provides a Quick Start guide and tips for code editing and debugging. It also has a FAQ that answers some frequently asked questions. Use the command **Java: Getting Started** from the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).

![Java Getting Started](images/java-tutorial/getting-started.png)

> **Note**: To configure multiple JDKs, see [Configure JDK](/docs/java/java-project.md#configure-jdk). To enable Java preview features, see [How can I use VS Code with new Java versions](/docs/java/java-faq.md#how-can-i-use-visual-studio-code-with-new-java-versions)

## Creating a source code file

Create a folder for your Java program and open the folder with VS Code. Then in VS Code, create a new file and save it with the name `Hello.java`. When you open that file, the Java Language Server automatically starts loading, and you should see a loading icon on the right side of the Status Bar. After it finishes loading, you will see a thumbs-up icon.

</video>

>**Note**: If you open a Java file in VS Code without opening its folder, the Java Language Server might not work properly.

VS Code will also try to figure out the correct package for the new type and fill the new file from a template. See [Create new file](/docs/java/java-editing.md#create-new-file).

You can also create a Java project using the **Java: Create Java Project** command. Bring up the **Command Palette**  (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and then type `java` to search for this command. After selecting the command, you will be prompted for the location and name of the project. You can also choose your build tool from this command.

Visual Studio Code also supports more complex Java projects, see [Project Management](/docs/java/java-project.md).

## Editing source code

You can use code snippets to scaffold your classes and methods. VS Code also provides IntelliSense for code completion, and various refactor methods.

To learn more about editing Java, see [Java Editing](/docs/java/java-editing.md).

## Running and debugging your program

To run and debug Java code, set a breakpoint, then either press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` on your keyboard or use the **Run** > **Start Debugging** menu item. You can also use the **Run|Debug** CodeLens options in the editor. After the code compiles, you can see all your variables and threads in the Run view.

The debugger also supports advanced features such as Hot Code replacement and conditional breakpoints.

For more information, see [Java Debugging](/docs/java/java-debugging.md).
