# Edit and debug with VS Code

From the Visual Studio Code File Explorer (`kb(workbench.view.explorer)`), navigate to your new `myExpressApp` folder and double-click the `app.js` file to open it in the editor.

## IntelliSense

You have syntax highlighting for the JavaScript file as well as IntelliSense with hovers, just like you would see if the source code was on your local machine.

When you start typing, you'll get smart completions for the object methods and properties.

## Debugging

Set a breakpoint on line 10 of `app.js` by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line number or by putting the cursor on the line and pressing `kb(editor.debug.action.toggleBreakpoint)`. The breakpoint will be displayed as a red circle.

Now, press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to run your application. If you are asked how to run the application, choose **Node.js**.

The app will start, and you'll hit the breakpoint. You can inspect variables, create watches, and navigate the call stack.

Press `kb(workbench.action.debug.stepOver)` to step or `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` again to finish your debugging session.

You get the full development experience of Visual Studio Code connected over SSH.

## Ending your SSH connection

You can end your session over SSH and go back to running VS Code locally with **File** > **Close Remote Connection**.
