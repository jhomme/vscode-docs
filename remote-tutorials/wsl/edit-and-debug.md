# Edit and debug with VS Code

## Installing the Python extension (and additional tools)

Click on `hello.py` to open it for editing. You will be prompted with an extension recommendation, in this case to install the [Microsoft Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension, which will give you rich editing and debugging experiences. Go ahead and select **Install** and reload if prompted.

To prove that the extension is installed in WSL, open the Extensions view again (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`). You will see a section titled **WSL â€“ Installed** and you can see any extensions that are installed on the WSL side.

Upon reload, you'll also get prompted telling you that the pylint linter is not installed. Linters are used to show errors and warnings in source code. Go ahead and select **Install**.

Now, when you edit your code, you get rich colorization and completions.

And when you save your file (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`), you'll get linting errors and warnings on the file.

## Debugging

With your tools set up, let's take this one step further. Set a breakpoint on line 1 of hello.py by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line number or by putting the cursor on the line and pressing `kb(editor.debug.action.toggleBreakpoint)`.

![set breakpoint](images/wsl/set-breakpoint.png)

Now, press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to run your application. You will be asked how to run the application, and since this is a simple file, just choose **Python File**.

![select debug configuration](images/wsl/select-debug-config.png)

The app will start, and you'll hit the breakpoint. You can inspect variables, create watches, and navigate the call stack.

Press `kb(workbench.action.debug.stepOver)` to step and you'll see the output of the print statement in the debug console.

You get the full development experience of Visual Studio Code, using the Linux instance installed in WSL.

If you want to open another folder in WSL, open the **File** menu and choose **Open Folder**. You'll get a minimal file and folder navigator for the Linux file system, not the Windows file system.

If you want to switch back to the Windows, select the **Show Local** option and you'll get the standard Windows File Open dialog.

## Ending your WSL connection

You can end your session in WSL and go back to running VS Code locally with **File** > **Close Remote Connection**.
