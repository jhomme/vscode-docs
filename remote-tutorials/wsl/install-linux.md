# Install a Linux distro

You install Linux distributions for WSL from the Microsoft Store. You can use the store app, or search for a Linux distro in the Windows search bar. Choose the Linux distribution you want to install (for example Ubuntu) and follow the prompts.

Select **Install**.

![install Ubuntu](images/wsl/install-ubuntu.png)

And when done, select **Launch** to get started. This will open a Linux terminal and complete the installation.  You'll need to create a user ID and password since you are setting up a full Linux instance. You are now running Linux on Windows.
