# Get the sample

To create a Docker container, we are going to clone a GitHub repository with a Node.js project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node
```

**Note**: There are other remote container samples such as `vscode-remote-try-python` or `vscode-remote-try-java`, but this tutorial will use `vscode-remote-try-node`.

## Open the repo in Visual Studio Code

Upon opening one of the sample projects listed above, you should see the following notification prompting you to reopen the workspace inside a dev container. Select **Reopen in Container**.

## Wait for the container to build

If this is your first time connecting, a Docker image will be downloaded, built, and starts a container with a copy of VS Code Server running. This might take a few minutes the first time, but future connections will only take seconds.

## Check

Once the container is running and you're connected, you should see your remote context change in the bottom left of the Status bar:
